This is the __static site__ repo for my hugo-powered blog, it contains all the
files under the docs/ folder. The content
files (e.g. post's markdown files) are stored in a separate repo [here](https://github.com/sibbs-gambling/blog) for version control purposes.
The content repo ignores the files in this repo, which are the files under docs/.

To see the actual blog site on github pages go to: https://sibbs-gambling.github.io/
